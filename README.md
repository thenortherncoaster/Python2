Hospital Management System
A simple Hospital Management System developed using Python and Tkinter for managing patient information, medication details, and prescriptions. The system allows users to input, update, delete, and view patient details, prescriptions, and medication information in a user-friendly graphical interface.

Features
Patient Information Management:

Record patient's personal details (ID, name, address, date of birth, NHS number).
Track patient medication details (tablet name, dosage, prescription, etc.).
Prescription Management:

Generate and display patient prescriptions including medication and dosage details.
Data Handling:

View patient details in a table with various columns (Patient ID, Name, NHS Number, etc.).
The system also supports updating and deleting records.
GUI Interface:

Built using Python's Tkinter library to provide a desktop-based graphical user interface (GUI).
Technologies Used
Python 3.x: Main programming language.
Tkinter: For the graphical user interface.
random: Used for generating random data or for simulations.
time & datetime: Used to handle time and date data.
ttk: For styling the widgets, such as ComboBoxes and Treeview.
Installation
To use the Hospital Management System, you will need Python 3.x installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.x (if not already installed):
Download and install Python 3 from official Python website.
2. Clone the repository:
Open a terminal/command prompt and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-management-system.git
3. Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd hospital-management-system
4. Install required packages:
This project relies on the Tkinter library, which is typically included with Python. If it's not installed, you can install it using:

For Windows:
bash
Copy code
pip install tk
For Linux:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
5. Run the project:
Once everything is set up, simply run the Python script using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python hospital_management_system.py
This will launch the Hospital Management System GUI.
